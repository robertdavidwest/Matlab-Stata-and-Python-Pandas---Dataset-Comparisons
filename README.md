Matlab-Stata-and-Python-Pandas---Dataset-Comparisons
====================================================

## Python Pandas, Matlab Datasets and Stata ##


TO BE FINISHED:

Somewhat inspired by the SciPy guide entitled [NumPy for Matlab Users](http://wiki.scipy.org/NumPy_for_Matlab_Users) was always a really useful tool for me when I first started using Python to help me quickly map between the 2 languages in terms of syntax to perform something similar in functionality 

as such I wanted to put something similar together in relation to datasets. Comparing 3 different languages the different syntax used to act on datasets across Python (the Pandas library), Matlab (the Dataset library) and Stata. These happen to be the 3 languages I've had exposure to in the way of datasets


in both python and Matlab, datasets are objects, in Stata every command is acting on a single dataset by default unless you tell it otherwise
